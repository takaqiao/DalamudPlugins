| Penny Pincher | tesu | Plugin for simplifying "pennying" (undercutting current lowest offer by 1).<br><br>The usual workflow for this is the following:<br>1.

Subtract one from it<br>5. Close the current listings window<br>6. Update your item's price with the number you noted<br>7. Confirm your new price<br><br>This plugin eliminates the mental notekeeping steps in the middle by automatically copying the number you want onto your clipboard when you open the current listings window.  <br><br>Therefore, your new workflow becomes this:<br>1. Open up the adjust price menu for the item you're undercutting<br>2. Click on the compare prices menu to view the current listings<br>3. Close the current listings window<br>4.
